# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative experience for everyone. We commit to an environment where individuals can learn from each other, share knowledge, and grow together. Our core values are curiosity, respect, transparency, responsibility, and team spirit.

## Our Standards

To foster a positive environment, we pledge to:

- **Curiosity**: Encourage and support inquisitiveness and continuous learning.
- **Respect**: Be considerate and respectful to all members, valuing each individual’s contributions and perspectives.
- **Transparency**: Communicate openly and honestly, and provide clear and constructive feedback.
- **Responsibility**: Take ownership of our actions and their impact on others, acknowledging and rectifying mistakes.
- **Team Spirit**: Work collaboratively, supporting and uplifting one another to achieve common goals.

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards others
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing appreciation for contributions and celebrating successes

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [your-email@example.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
