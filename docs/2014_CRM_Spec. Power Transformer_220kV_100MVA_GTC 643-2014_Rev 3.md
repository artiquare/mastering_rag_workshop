## Transformers, regulators and reactors [for audible sound levels]

IEC 60296 & IEC 60422- Insulating Oil

The technical data schedules for the specified transformers are within Section 3.4.

## 1.3 General

Transformers shall be outdoor, oil-immersed, three-phase type, generally with on-load tap-changer. (Exceptions with off-circuit tap-changer are detailed in Clause 1.3.11, 'Voltage Control' of this specification.) They shall comply with the requirements of the schedules and standards listed in Clause 1.2 above and other relevant IEC standards.
